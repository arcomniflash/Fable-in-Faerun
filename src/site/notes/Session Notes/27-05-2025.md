- Fina and Saska have ice creams in Waukeen's Promenade.
- Merrick buys a Potion of Healing (50Gp) from an innocent and totally unassuming trader in Waukeen's promenade.
- At a clothing shop, the group buys some clothes and meets Danika Emberlay. 
- Leaving the promenade while their clothing is being tailored, the group heads to the church of Selune, where Fina meets with Sister Elyrinya.  She introduces the sister to the rest of the group.
- They talk to the sister who tells them about the raids on the temple, and other actions, by a group who are probably the Church of Shar.
