**Current Experience**
**Fina: 13538**
**Merrick: 12500**
**Saska: 11992**

- Saska and Merrick return from the market with apples.
- Once they have finished reading, the group meet with Lady Syrana Dannihyr.  Lady Dannihyr tries to warn Fina that her father, Lord Dannihyr has it out for her, but this comes across an awful lot like a death threat given that she is surrounded by shadow thief thugs.
- Afterwards the group retreats to an alley and discusses leaving the city for a little bit (and about Fina's parents again).
- The group stakes out the temple of Selune to see if any followers of Shar show up.
- Fina and Saska sleep at Mithrest in.
- Veren watches over the inn just in cast.
- In the morning they go and see Solomon, they tell him that they are leaving the city for the Bramblewood for a few days.  They also talk to Solomon about having him set up a meeting with Lady Chainstone, so that Fina can talk to her.
