- The party debates about whether to go directly to warehouse 9 or to go and see Mr Solomon at the House of Law to get help.
- They eventually decide to go to Warehouse 9.
- The party spots Riven Vorst coming out of the warehouse, one of the guards mouths off to him and is quickly cowed.
- Vern scouts around the side of the warehouse to get a look inside through the windows.
- They all sneak into the warehouse and then start a fight on the first floor.  Merrick comes straight through the window to the upper office, and challenges the warehouse master, who tries to run away, slashing at Fina on his way out.
- Fina casts Sleet Storm on the warehouse - effectively locking down the thugs inside.
- They make the warehouse master, Brock Ordwell, surrender and got him to show them the way downstairs.
- In the basement, Merrick kicked open the door, triggering a shaped explosive.
- Behind the door they found the lab where the poison is being mixed, with a gnome who looked to be in charge.
