# Description

At the bend of Bramblewood’s main lane, a dusty dirt track, just beside a leaning willow and a row of sun-bleached crates, sits Pennyroot Oven, the village bakery that everyone recognizes by scent before sight. Its walls are daubed in soft clay-white, its tiled roof bursting with stray herbs and wildflowers, and its hanging sign bears the image of a crusty round loaf wrapped in fern leaves.

The front door creaks charmingly on its hinges, and each time it opens, a little brass bell shaped like a honey drop gives a cheerful jingle. Inside, the air is warm and rich—flour-dusted and cozy, with the scent of clove, fruit peel, and slow-roasted grain drifting through the beams. Wide wicker trays hold spelt rolls, cinnamon-swirled brioche, and tiny hand pies packed with pear and sage. But the local favourite is the raspberry-rose scone, topped with a whisper of sugar glaze that sticks just right to your fingertips.

The bakery is run by Tilda Thistlewick, a soft-voiced woman in her sixties with cheeks like toasted apples and a laugh as gentle as kneaded dough. Her sleeves are always rolled up, her apron perpetually smudged, and she greets every visitor by name (and preferred snack). Her niece, Marra, rushes to make deliveries of baked goods to the local farmers.

Villagers say the ovens, built of old river stone and driftwood bricks, have never failed to rise a loaf. During long winters, Pennyroot Oven stays open late, its windows fogged with steam and light, offering slices of buttered rye and spiced tea to anyone needing warmth, company, or a bit of news.

# Notable Characters

### Tilda Thistlewick

Tilda Lurenn is a strong, cheerful woman in her sixties who’s spent most of her life standing beside a warm oven. She’s got broad shoulders, a round face with rosy cheeks, and always smells faintly of cinnamon and fresh bread. Her hands are firm and practiced—good for kneading dough or patting a crying child on the back.

Her hair is a soft mix of pale blonde and silver, tied back with a bit of cloth. She wears layers of loose skirts and a thick apron, often smudged with flour, jam, or butter. Her apron has little patches and tiny stitched herbs and leaves—gifts from local children, who love her like a favourite aunt.

Tilda’s brown eyes are warm and quick to spot trouble—or mischief. She laughs easily and speaks with the friendly tone of someone who knows every name and story in the village. When it’s chilly, she adds a wool shawl pinned with a copper brooch shaped like a thistle.

She’s not fancy, but she’s the heart of her bakery. Folks say walking into Pennyroot Oven is a bit like getting a warm hug—and Tilda is the reason why.

### Marra Thistlewick

Marra is a sprightly young woman in her early twenties with a quick smile and flour on her sleeves more often than not. She’s medium height and lean, with long legs that carry her at a half-run through most of her errands—especially when balancing a bread basket on one hip.

Her hair is a tumble of copper curls, usually tied up with a ribbon that never quite matches her apron. Her face is round, sun-kissed, and dusted with freckles, and her eyes—bright hazel—crinkle at the corners when she laughs, which is often.

She dresses simply: a cotton blouse with rolled-up sleeves, a faded skirt, and a patchy apron that somehow still smells like warm honey. There’s usually a smudge of jam on her cheek or a bit of flour in her hair, and she carries the energy of someone who loves both her work and her village.
