# Description

The blacksmith’s shop in Bramblewood sits low and wide, built from thick river stone and dark timber beams weathered by years of sun and rain. The roof is steep and shingled with slate, patched here and there with hammered tin. Most mornings, a thin plume of smoke curls from the brick chimney at the back, carrying the warm scent of coal and scorched iron.

The front of the building is open to the road, with wide double doors often propped open to let in light and passers-by. An iron bell hangs above the lintel, rung by farmers bringing in broken tools or travellers needing quick repairs. A heavy wooden awning stretches out over stacks of firewood, a few wagon wheels, and half-finished pieces waiting to be cooled and shaped.

Inside, the forge glows steadily in a rear corner, its stone hearth blackened from years of use. The anvil stands square in the packed-earth floor, surrounded by hooks of hammers, tongs, and lengths of iron and steel. A quieter side room, shaded and cool, holds finer work—hinges, latches, and the occasional horseshoe with a decorative curl.

The whole place smells of heat and honest labour. It’s not fancy, but the walls are solid, the floor swept, and the work respected.

# Notable Characters

### Garlan Whetley

Garlan Whetley was born the eldest of four in a family of traveling tinkers, his early years spent along winding trade roads and in roadside camps. His father mended kettles and sharpened blades, while his mother bartered for food with handmade hinges and lock plates. From them, Garlan inherited both a love of the forge and a deep-rooted appreciation for quiet craftsmanship.

He settled in Bramblewood in his early twenties, drawn not by coin or contract, but by the steady promise of a small village that needed strong hands and honest work. With help from local farmers and a few hard seasons, he built the smithy with his own stone and sweat. Over time, his reputation grew—not flashy, but dependable—the kind of man you go to when something breaks and you want it fixed right the first time.

Now in his late fifties, Garlan still works the anvil most mornings, keeping pace with orders for tools, hardware, and the occasional weapon for passing adventurers. He tends to the heavy work—ploughshares, hinges, horseshoes, and axe heads—leaving the finer, more delicate pieces to his daughter Elsin, whose talent he nurtures with a proud if weathered hand.

Locals know him as quiet and deliberate, a man who listens more than he speaks, and when he does, it’s usually worth hearing. He shares the forge with Elsin not just as family, but as a craftsman to his equal, though he sometimes grumbles about her "fancy curls" in ironwork while secretly saving the best for display on the front wall.

### Elsin Whetley

Elsin Whetley grew up with coal dust on her sleeves and the hiss of quenching steel in her ears. From the moment she could lift a hammer, she was at her father’s side—watching, learning, and testing the boundaries of tradition. While her childhood was steeped in the fundamentals of forge work, Elsin was always chasing refinement. Where Garlan shaped strength, Elsin sought beauty within it.

Now in her late twenties, Elsin handles much of the detailed and decorative work at the blacksmith’s shop: ornamental latches, patterned horseshoes, custom hinges, and the light weapons she dreams of one day crafting for an adventuring company passing through. Her hands are as calloused as any smith’s, but her eye for balance and proportion borders on artistry.

Though she and her father butt heads from time to time—especially over her “unnecessary flourishes”—there’s a deep mutual respect between them. She’s every bit his match at the anvil, and in recent years, more and more villagers specifically request her work when commissioning anything more delicate than a hinge.
