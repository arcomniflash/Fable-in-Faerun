# Description

The Cobin Farm sits just north of Bramblewood, tucked among sloping fields and weather-worn fence lines. Its main building is a sturdy, low-roofed structure of timber and stone, surrounded by an old stone wall stacked high and thick, more for tradition than true defence. Smoke curls gently from the chimney most mornings, and the scent of hay and livestock drifts down the hill when the wind turns right.

Behind the main building lies a well-worn chicken coop, its timber faded from seasons of sun and rain, with a tangle of scratched earth and feathers at its feet. Hens wander freely during the day, scratching near the wall, only to be herded back in at dusk.

To the west, about two hundred yards beyond a small groups of hawthorn and beech, lies a quiet lake, still and glassy when the breeze drops. A narrow wooden jetty juts from the grassy shore—weathered but firm, just long enough for a quiet moment or a dangling line. Deer sometimes drink there in the mornings, and frogs claim the banks by night.

The fields surrounding the farm are a patchwork of rotating crops—barley here, root vegetables there, with rows of beans and brassicas tucked wherever the soil holds well. Stone markers and rickety scarecrows divide the plots, and in high summer, the land hums with growth and birdsong.

# Notable Characters

### Robert Cobin

Robert Cobin has spent his whole life rooted in the soil north of Bramblewood, and most days he seems carved from the same stone that rings his pasture. Towering at six foot three, with shoulders broad enough to bear a yoke without flinching, he’s a man of great presence and little patience. For decades he’s run Cobin Farm with sheer strength, a booming voice, and no small number of bruised tavern benches from bar fights he never bothered to avoid.

He and his wife, Meryl, built their life there side by side. She’s not a farmer in the strictest sense—Meryl leaves the fieldwork to others—but she keeps the house in good order, tends the hearth, manages stores and meals, and knows every crack in every floorboard like a familiar tune. When Robert storms in, reeking of sweat and frustration, it’s usually Meryl’s voice that calms him, or at least redirects his anger toward a fence post that actually deserves it.

Together they raised six children: five sons—Bram, Joren, Bryne, Elroy, and Leif—and a daughter, Saska, bright as a flint spark and just as sharp. Joren’s long gone to merchant work, while Bram and Bryne handle most of the day-to-day now, with Elroy and Leif still finding their footing.

But something in Robert changed fifteen years ago, during the midsummer festival. He’s felt unsettled ever since—as if something important was taken, though he can’t name what. Saska believes it’s because they once had another daughter, Elouise, stolen away by a fairy queen that very night. Robert refuses to believe it. How could a father forget a child? What kind of man would that make him?

He blames the druidess and her daughter, who lured Saska into the woods that night and nearly lost her to whatever magic dwells in the trees. Since then, he won’t speak of the matter—his temper flares too fast—and while others see a man still in command, Meryl knows the ache beneath. She says little, keeps the hearth warm, and sometimes watches her husband stare toward the trees with fists clenched, not in anger, but in fear.

### Meryl Cobin

Meryl Cobin was never fond of noise for its own sake. Raised on a quiet orchard two valleys east of Bramblewood, she learned early how to keep a household running with little fuss and fewer words. She met Robert at a harvest fair—he’d won the hog wrestling contest and lost his boot in the process. She gave it back to him with a raised brow and a dry remark, and he married her not long after.

She’s kept the Cobin household in order ever since, raising six children in a home where mud tracked in was less a problem than a sign someone was doing their job. While Robert wrangled livestock and stubborn sons, Meryl saw to meals, mending, and the quiet miracle of having clean linens even during lambing season.

She’s not a farmer in the fieldwork sense—she doesn’t wrangle pigs or chase chickens—but she knows every jar in the pantry, every blanket in the chest, and every trick to calming a crying babe or an angry husband. She’s the one who taught Saska to braid, scolded Elroy into decent posture, and makes sure Bram doesn’t forget whose boots are whose.

These days, Meryl keeps mostly to the kitchen and hearth, though her hands are rarely still. She’s the one with the calm voice during a storm and the sharp look that can cut short a foolish argument at the dinner table. And though she says little about it, she remembers that midsummer night fifteen years ago as clearly as any storm she’s ever weathered.

### Bram Cobin

Bram Cobin is the kind of man who steps up before he's asked—broad-shouldered, even-tempered, and steady as a plough horse. As the eldest of the six Cobin children, he grew up under his father’s watchful eye and heavy expectations, learning early that strength wasn’t just about lifting sacks but standing firm when others faltered.

From a young age, Bram took on responsibility without fuss. Whether it was breaking a new colt, patching a flooded pen, or calming a panicked sibling, he handled it all with that quiet confidence that makes others fall in behind. He’s not one for long speeches or idle chatter, but when Bram speaks, folks listen—and more often than not, do as he says.

He shares most of the farm work these days with his brother Bryne, keeping the Cobin name and fields in good order as their father’s temper turns more toward reflection than direction. Bram is practical, dependable, and strong as a beam, but there’s an ease to the way he moves—a man not rushing, just carrying the weight because someone must.

Among the siblings, he’s especially protective of Leif, the youngest—a soft-spoken, thoughtful boy with more books than tools in his room. Bram doesn’t always understand his little brother’s quiet world of ink and imagination, but he never mocks it, and he’s been known to patch a fence solo just so Leif can finish a chapter in peace.

### Bryne Cobin

Bryne Cobin was always the one with wandering feet and a silver tongue. He had his father's height, his mother's sharp eye, and none of the patience for milking cows or mucking stalls. As a boy, he could talk a neighbour into trading apples for turnips twice over, and slip out of chores with a grin and half a promise.

By seventeen, the farm felt too small for his ambitions. He packed light, said goodbye with a smirk that didn’t quite reach his eyes, and left to chase coin, stories, and a future that didn’t involve early mornings and muddy boots. No one stopped him—but no one expected him back soon either.

Since then, the Cobins have heard little. A letter now and then—never more than a paragraph—arrives with foreign stamps or dusty ink. _“Doing well,”_ it says. _“Training with a guild in trade matters,”_ or _“Weather fine. Found good footing.”_ No return address. No clear path.

Some say he’s a merchant’s apprentice in Eldmere. Others whisper he’s in the coastal cities, dealing in silks or secrets. Meryl keeps every letter folded in her apron drawer, and Robert pretends not to ask when the next might come.

### Elroy Cobin

Elroy Cobin has always been the quiet mind behind strong hands. While Bram led with muscle and certainty, Elroy stood half a step behind, thinking before acting and weighing outcomes others overlooked. He’s every bit as capable in the field—his frame sturdy, his movements purposeful—but where Bram thrives on motion, Bryne lingers, observing the soil, the patterns of clouds, and the habits of hens like someone solving a puzzle no one else sees.

He reads when he can—old farm almanacs, herbal guides, stories of the old gods—and though he rarely speaks at length, his words carry the weight of someone who chooses each with care. His younger siblings often say he’s the one to ask when something strange happens in the crops or a calf won’t feed.

Most of the Cobin family worships Lathander, the Morninglord, bringing prayers to dawn’s light and growth’s renewal. But Elroy quietly offers thanks to Chauntea, the Great Mother. To him, it makes sense—who better to guide the turning of seasons and the balance of furrows than the goddess of soil and harvest herself? He tends a modest shrine to her behind the grain barn, shielded by ivy and stones, and few disturb it.

Though he lacks his father's stormy presence or Joren’s charm, Elroy has become indispensable to the rhythm of the farm—the one who remembers the planting rotations, anticipates weather shifts, and knows precisely when the chickens start to lay late. He doesn’t ask for recognition, and seems perfectly content in the quiet space between the barn and the barley rows, where sun and earth speak in language only he’s taken time to learn.

### Joren Cobin

Joren Cobin is all elbows and opinions, the kind of boy who always had dirt on his knees and an argument on the tip of his tongue. He’s the fourth of the Cobin sons, wedged between the introspective Bryne and the bookish Leif, and perhaps because of it, he carved out a space for himself through sheer personality alone.

Not as broad as Bram or as thoughtful as Elroy, Joren thrives on movement and mischief. He’s quick-footed, quicker-witted, and has a grin that spells trouble more often than not. He once snuck a piglet into the village schoolhouse “just to see what would happen,” and while the results were chaotic, the story still gets told at family meals—with Meryl sighing and Robert trying not to smile.

Joren works the farm like the others, mostly handling odd jobs: herding chickens, fixing broken hinges, clearing brush near the western fields. He’s good with animals, terrible with routine, and often seen helping Leif rig strange contraptions or roping Saska into hare-brained plans involving rope swings and half-built rafts.

Where Bram commands respect and Elroy earns trust, Joren sparks laughter and aggravation in equal measure. He’s the sibling most likely to get caught climbing the old watchtower or testing how long a goose can be reasoned with (answer: not long).

### Lief Cobin

Leif Cobin is the youngest of the Cobin clan, and the one most often found with his nose in a book rather than mud on his boots. Where his brothers brawled, raced, and wrestled pigs for fun, Leif preferred quiet corners, ink-stained fingers, and questions no one else thought to ask. He’s slender and soft-spoken, with thoughtful eyes and a voice barely louder than the rustling pages he turns at dusk.

While not uninterested in the farm, Leif has always approached it from a different angle—curious about crop cycles and animal habits not for duty, but for understanding. He can recite planting calendars, tell you why the barley bent early after the last frost, and once spent three days trying to teach a chicken to recognize colours (with mixed results). Most assume he’ll become a scribe or healer someday, maybe even study with the druids—though Robert grumbles at such talk, and Meryl quietly makes sure his ink pots stay filled.

Among his siblings, he’s closest to Bryne, who shares his contemplative nature, and to Elroy—though the latter teases him endlessly, it’s often Leif’s observations that get them out of trouble. He’s also the one Saska confides in most when she’s caught between fire and silence.

Leif keeps a bundle of scrolls hidden in the attic, full of sketches, stories, and strange maps of things he’s seen in dreams. He may not yet know what path he’s on—but he’s walking it one careful step at a time, eyes wide and mind open.

### Ratter

Ratter came to the Cobin farm as a scruffy, overexcited pup—traded at market more for his energy than his instincts. Where Charlie, Saska’s old dog, had been calm and reliable, Ratter is a whirlwind of bark and bounce, always chasing chickens, shadows, or his own tail.

Though not the brightest, he’s loyal and full of heart, quick to raise the alarm and first to greet the children at the door. He’s especially fond of Meryl and often curls by her feet near the hearth. Every now and then, he pauses at the northern fence, ears up, as if remembering the one who walked that path before.

He’s no legend like Charlie, but he’s found his place—muddy paws, loud bark, and all.
