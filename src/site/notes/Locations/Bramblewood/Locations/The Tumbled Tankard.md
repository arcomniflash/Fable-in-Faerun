# Description

The Tumbled Tankard is the sole inn in Bramblewood, doubling as the local tavern. Its timber frame lists slightly as though the building itself once joined a bar brawl and never quite recovered. The wattle-and-daub walls are softened with creeping ivy, and a crooked copper weather vane—shaped like a falling tankard—spins atop a roof of patchy thatch and mismatched slate.

Carved into the lintel above the heavy oak door are the words: _“Where all roads slope toward mischief.”_

Inside, the place is all warm woods, low beams, and lived-in charm. The main room features a central hearth whose mantle overflows with old tankards, burnt tavern tokens, and the occasional pair of lucky boots nailed in tribute. Mismatched chairs and sturdy tables circle outward like petals, worn smooth by generations of elbows and spilled stew.

A dangerously tilted staircase leads to a snug upstairs loft where travellers bunk in creaky cots, separated by heavy curtains and the mutual agreement not to snore too loud. There's also a small stage—more of a raised plank, really, that bards, minstrels and storytellers use to ply their trade.  It is also occasionally used for various singing competitions that have been known to end badly.

The tavern is no stranger to the odd bar brawl, but the locals can be relied upon to shut down any mischief quickly almost as soon as it starts - with either soft words or hard fists.

# Notable Characters

### Grisham Ramasar

The human owner of the Tumbled Tankard, Grisham sometimes serves as the bartender of the tavern, but generally leaves that to his wife and son.  At first glance, he looks quite fat and somewhat gruff, but further inspection reveals that his girth is actually more muscle than fat, built up from years of hauling around beer kegs and lifting crates.   Grisham has the tanned, olive skin that is common to those from central Amn, the only hair on his head are from his heavy brow and thick moustache.  Grisham is always up to toss out unruly patrons, and most of the men in town treat him with a begrudging respect.  This is all despite the fact that he is somewhat short, at only 5'5" tall, and that he isn't particularly good at dealing with women.  Everyone in the village knows that Grisham will never raise his hand to a woman, preferring to leave such confrontations to his wife.

### Aileen Ramasar

Aileen is Grisham's long suffering wife, she is slightly taller than her husband with the same olive coloured skin.  A human standing about 5'6" tall, Aileen likely once had jet black hair, but it has started to fade to grey as she gets older.  Stocky with a slightly fat nose and dimpled cheeks, Aileen can usually be found behind the bar of the tavern.  She's a pleasant woman to talk to and always has an ear for the local gossip, which she is quick to spread amongst her clientele.  From time to time, Aileen is called upon to throw out any female patrons who've had too much to drink - while she would never go so far as to try this with anyone who seems well trained or dangerous, she's done this enough that she can herd out any of the local women who're deep in their cups.

### Rendyl Ramasar

Grisham and Aileen's 14 year old son, Rendyl has inherited his father's stockiness and height, though it is entirely possible that he might grow taller than his father when he gets older.  Aileen has already been having Rendyl help out at the tavern, and his main job seems to be taking care of any horses that are kept in the attached stables overnight, or waiting tables whenever he isn't doing that.  The boy is thick limbed, olive skinned and with a somewhat lopsided grin.  He could never really be considered handsome, but he's friendly enough that a few of the girls in town seem interested in his company.  It is well known that Rendyl wants to get out of town at some point and go travelling, a dream that might be in jeopardy if his father gets his wish of having the boy take over the Tumbled Tankard when he and his wife get old.
