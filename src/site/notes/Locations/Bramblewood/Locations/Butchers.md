# Description

Figg and Sons is a small, well-worn butcher’s shop tucked between the cooper’s yard and the old stone well near the heart of Bramblewood. The sign above the door is hand-painted with a red boar and faded gold lettering, its edges softened by years of wind and rain. Inside, the air smells of smoked meat, fresh herbs, and sawdust scattered across the stone floor.

Thaddan Figg, a broad-shouldered man with a tidy beard and sleeves always rolled to the elbow, runs the shop with his two sons—Merrit, the quiet one who does most of the curing and chopping, and Joss, who handles the front with a grin and a dozen stories for every customer.

The counter is a thick slab of oak, behind which hang strings of sausages, sides of bacon, and the occasional roast bird on market days. A chalkboard lists what’s fresh that week—often including salt pork, lamb shanks, spiced mutton pies, and jars of lard or dripping kept cool in the back cellar.

Locals trust Figg and Sons not just for fair prices and clean cuts, but because they’ve been feeding Bramblewood for three generations. It’s the kind of place where the butcher knows your favourite cut and your grandmother’s stew recipe by heart.

# Notable Characters

### Thaddan Figg

Thaddan Figg was born and raised in Bramblewood, the third son of a butcher who ran the shop before him. He spent most of his childhood sweeping floors, hauling firewood, and learning how to choose the best cuts from sides of beef twice his size. When his older brothers left to chase coin in Athkatla, Thaddan stayed behind—not out of fear, but because he already knew what he wanted: to keep the smokehouse warm and the bell above the shop door ringing.

He took over Figg and Sons in his late twenties, after his father fell ill, and slowly grew it into the dependable heart of Bramblewood it is today. He married young, lost his wife far too soon, and raised his two boys, Merrit and Joss, with quiet care and long hours. Folks say he never raised his voice once in their childhood—but they always listened when he spoke.

Though he rarely travels beyond the village, Thaddan knows every face within twenty miles and every stew pot they fill. He’s butcher, neighbor, and—some would argue—part storyteller too, trading gossip for gossip as he wraps pork chops in brown paper.

### Merrit Figg

Merrit Figg has spent most of his life behind the thick oak counter of Figg and Sons, learning the rhythm of cleavers, smoke, and early mornings from his father, Thaddan. The quieter of the two Figg brothers, Merrit was always the one who listened more than he spoke—watching how each cut was made, how customers were greeted, and how the family name was earned loaf by loaf and chop by chop.

When he was younger, some thought he might leave the village—he had a sharp mind and a steady hand, and the big cities always seemed hungry for skilled tradesmen. But Merrit stayed. Not out of fear or lack of ambition, but because he genuinely loves Bramblewood, its slow pace and honest work. He took to curing meats and smoking hams with quiet pride, eventually becoming the one who oversees most of the backroom prep and preservation.

### Joss Figg

Joss Figg grew up in the thick of the butcher’s shop, though unlike his brother Merrit, he was always more interested in the _people_ than the process. From a young age, he’d sneak off mid-shift to swap jokes with the cooper’s apprentice or trade bits of sausage for stories at [[Locations/Bramblewood/Locations/The Tumbled Tankard\|The Tumbled Tankard]]. While he learned the trade just as well as Merrit—he can joint a chicken blindfolded, or so he claims—it was clear he had a gift for chatter and charm more than quiet focus.

After a short and unimpressive stint trying to join a merchant caravan (he made it as far as Crimmor before coming home with a sprained ankle and a busted lute), Joss returned to Bramblewood with a new appreciation for the steadiness of home. These days, he handles the front of Figg and Sons, greeting customers with an easy grin, chatting about village gossip, and hawking pies like a bard on market day.
