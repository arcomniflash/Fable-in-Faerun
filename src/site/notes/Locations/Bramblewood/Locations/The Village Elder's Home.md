# Notable Characters

### Merrow Howitt

Old Merrow Howitt is in his late eighties, with a hunched back and skin like worn parchment. His hair is thin and white, and he usually tucks it behind his ears. A scruffy beard lines his jaw, and a wide old hat always sits low on his head. Most days, he’s chewing gently on the end of his wooden pipe, whether it’s lit or not.

Merro isn’t very tall, and his clothes are a patchwork of wool and leather, full of little pockets holding herbs, notes, or small shiny things he finds interesting. Around his neck, he wears a flat copper pendant etched with a strange old symbol—no one really knows what it means, but some say it was a gift from a wandering wizard years ago.

He speaks slowly, with a deep voice and a patient tone. Folks listen when he talks. He remembers old tales, knows which plants heal and which mushrooms to avoid, and he settles most arguments with just a look and a short word. Some say his memory is slipping, but others believe he forgets things on purpose.

Children love him. He’s like a walking storybook. Farmers trust his weather guesses more than the sky, and travelers are often surprised by how much he seems to know—sometimes even things he couldn’t possibly have heard about.
