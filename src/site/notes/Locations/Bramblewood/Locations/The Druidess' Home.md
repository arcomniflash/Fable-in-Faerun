# Description

Tucked at the edge of the Bramblewood Hollow, where the trees begin to thicken and moss softens the sound of footfalls, stands a two-story timber-and-stone cottage, weathered but sturdy. Its roof, pitched sharply to shed the northern rains, is half-covered in creeping ivy. Small, irregularly shaped windows blink like amber eyes from both floors, framed in carved wooden shutters painted the color of late summer leaves. A twist of smoke rises from a crooked stone chimney, scented faintly of birch bark and lavender.

Behind the cottage lies a walled garden—not manicured, but alive with intention. Rows of flowering herbs spill over cobbled paths: yarrow, foxglove, vervain, and other less-nameable flora that glimmer oddly in certain light. Bees hum lazily in the air. A row of willow hoops dries under the eaves, and wind chimes made from bone and shell sing softly when the breeze stirs.

The villagers call it “the Hollow House,” though none truly know what lies within.

# Notable Characters

### Lyra Kaye

Lyra was not born in Bramblewood. She arrived on the back of a wind-worn pony, her voice soft and her eyes reflecting the sky just before nightfall. Raised within the Circle of Eclipsed Branches, a quiet druidic order devoted to Selûne, she trained in the ways of balance and guidance under moonlight's watch. The Circle believed that the world moved in cycles—growth, rest, bloom, decay—and Selûne's silver light was the thread that stitched it all together.

Unlike others who worshipped the Lady of Silver from stone temples or gilded sanctuaries, Lyra honored her in wild clearings and by planting moonflowers. Her faith was less doctrine, more devotion—soft chants by starlight, offerings of dew-soaked petals, and dreams laced with lunar clarity. The silver crescent she wears around her neck was carved from bleached yew, not precious metal.

She met Lachlan during her first summer in Bramblewood. He had been gathering windfallen branches for carving near the forest’s edge, unaware that the grove he stepped into was sacred. Lyra confronted him—quietly, not angrily—and what began as a caution turned into conversation.

Lachlan, with his patient hands and knack for shaping wood into art, didn’t flinch at her strange ways. He listened. He asked. And when he brought her a carved crescent wolf a week later, wordless, she simply nodded and made him tea with star anise and chamomile. They were married in the glade that autumn, with no priest, no witnesses but the trees, and Selûne’s round face watching overhead.

Fina came later—a babe no more than a year old, found deep in the fern-choked hollow on the north slope of the woods. No one in the village claimed her. Some whispered she was fey-touched, others that she was gifted—or cursed.  When Lachlan brought Fina home, Lyra named the girl for the forest's whisper, and raised her as both daughter and student.

Now that the girl has left home, Lyra feels an emptiness.  Lachlan is often out ranging, and when that happens she is left alone in her empty house.  Luckily, there are many animals that keep her company during these trying times.

The village remains wary of Lyra—of the herbs that calm too quickly, the moon chants, and the silence that sometimes hums louder than sound. But when illness strikes or crops sour or a child dreams of shadows, it is to her they go. And she answers—with a tincture, a word, or a moon-blessed charm drawn in salt.

### Lachlan Kaye

Lachlan grew up in Bramblewood, the kind of boy who preferred walking the forest trails to talking in town. His parents made baskets and charcoal, but Lachlan always felt drawn to the woods themselves. While others hunted or chopped trees, he watched over them—a quiet protector, more ranger than woodsman.

He also carved small things—animals, moon shapes, bits of forest magic—just for the joy of it. He never sold them. Sometimes he’d leave one tucked in a hollow tree or under a stone, like a quiet blessing.

Lachlan met Lyra when he accidentally wandered into one of her sacred groves. He was gathering wood; she stepped out of the trees to stop him. They didn’t argue. They talked. A few days later, he gave her a carving of a crescent wolf, and she made him tea. That’s how it began. They married under the trees with only the stars as witnesses.

It was Lachlan who found Fina, lying in a fern-filled hollow deep in the forest. She was only a baby, alone and asleep, with a strange silver vine wrapped around her wrist.  He took pity on the girl, whose parents were nowhere to be found and, considering that she might be the lost child of someone in the village, or maybe even have been abandoned by one of them, he took her back to the home he shared with Lyra.  When none of the villagers claimed the girl, and without children of their own, he and Lyra decided to raise the girl themselves.

The villages in Bramblewood spoke in whispers about how strange the child was, about how the air always seems a little colder when she is around, and how she has a stare that was just that little bit unnerving.  As she grew, Lachlan taught the girl all about the forest and the animals, while her mother taught her about the trees and the plants.   They discovered that she had a talent for magic, though it was clearly not like the nature magic that Lyra practiced.

These days, Lachlan spends his time between watching the forest—keeping it safe and balanced—and shaping wood into small, beautiful charms.  Though he would never say so, it's clear enough to Lyra that he feels Fina's absence now that she has left to go to the big city, and he's the first to intercept any letter that the girl sends.
