# Description

Perched on the gentle rise of a sun-dappled hillside, the Windemere estate sprawls across manicured grounds like a living portrait of refinement and quiet power. The manor at its heart stands two stories tall with an elegantly peaked attic, its façade a pristine sweep of white stone, softened by ivy and flowering vines that climb its walls like nature’s embroidery. Tall arched windows glint with the late afternoon light, framed by wrought-iron balconies and aged copper shutters green with patina.

The garden unfolds in formal symmetry—fragrant rose beds, ornamental shrubs trimmed with geometric precision, and a winding hedge maze that whispers of childhood secrets and noble intrigue. At every corner of the maze, lifelike statues of knights in solemn vigil guard the paths with stone lances and silent oaths. Humming softly with magical life, small golems of polished stone and packed earth move methodically through flowerbeds, pruning blossoms and brushing soil from delicate leaves.

Beyond the manor, the land dips into a lush vineyard, its rows perfectly aligned like pages in a noble ledger. Vines heavy with dusky grapes bask in golden light, their sweetness fed by enchanted irrigation channelled from a nearby spring. The air is rich with the scent of lavender and ripe fruit.

### Golems

These small constructs are no taller than a child, made of tightly compacted soil and jagged stones smoothed by time and purpose.  Each one has a slightly different shape: some more rounded like oversized river pebbles stacked into limbs, others angular and asymmetrical with moss growing in the cracks of their torsos.

Their 'faces' are simple - shallow indentations suggesting eyes, and a hint of a nose or mouth shaped by root-like etchings. Despite their silence, they radiate a gentle presence, their movements slow, deliberate, and oddly graceful.

From their backs, shoulders, or even the tops of their heads, plants flourish—sprigs of rosemary, creeping ivy, wildflowers, and in a few remarkable cases, clusters of pale green grapes. These are not mere ornamentation; the plants seem to be part of them, drawing nourishment from the same magical life that animates the golems. When they pause in their work, the grape-bearing ones hum softly, a low vibration that stirs the vines around them in rhythm—an old enchantment to encourage healthy crops.

Most wield miniature tools: pruning shears made of polished copper, watering cans carved from clay, or rakes no larger than a child’s toy. They never speak, but occasionally they tilt their heads toward one another, as if sharing secrets beneath the rustle of leaves and the soft crunch of their stone feet on gravel paths.

# Notable Characters

### Lady Carmilla Windemere

Lady Carmilla Windemere possesses a presence that lingers long after she’s gone—a figure carved in memory like a fading sigil etched in moonlight. Even from fleeting glimpses, she strikes the eye as tall and imperious, her frame slender but never frail, with a bearing that suggests she’s spent a lifetime commanding rooms far grander than parlours tucked in Amnian hills.

Her face is angular, sculpted rather than soft, with high cheekbones and a narrow, aristocratic nose. Time has lined her skin with the fine etchings of age and intellect—creases that form not from laughter but from concentration, from narrowing the eyes at schematics and spell matrices. Her complexion is pale, a kind of porcelain grey touched by candlelight, and her lips are thin and usually drawn in a thoughtful, unsmiling line.

Her hair is a silver-white cascade, coiled into an intricate bun at the back of her head, often bound with stylized pins shaped like alchemical symbols or mechanical instruments. In certain lights, faint enchantments woven into her hairpins catch a glint—tiny sparks of motion, illusion, or control.

When she walks, she does so with fluid precision, her every movement suggesting clockwork grace rather than effort. Her clothing is always impeccable and slightly anachronistic—layered gowns or robes in shades of ash, indigo, and tarnished bronze, trimmed in delicate embroidery that resembles circuit lines or magical glyphs. No jewellery, save perhaps a single gloved hand resting on a carved cane—not for support, but for authority.

### Wallace Greywell - Butler

Wallace Greywell carries himself with the poise of a finely tuned clock—precise, timeless, and utterly composed. He stands just over six feet tall with a lean, wiry frame that suggests efficiency over brawn. His pale, gaunt face is clean-shaven and sharply defined, the cheekbones high, the jaw refined but firm, and his pale blue eyes thoughtful and a touch distant—as though he’s always appraising, calculating, or remembering something quietly vital.

His hair is grey, combed meticulously back from a widow’s peak, never out of place even in the vineyard wind. His eyebrows are dark and neat, giving his steady gaze extra weight. His skin is pale, though he has the faintest constellation of old sunspots on his temples, hints of a youth spent somewhere warmer than Bramblewood.

Wallace wears a custom-tailored coat of deep charcoal, trimmed with the dusty blue livery of House Windemere, over a high-collared ivory shirt and storm-coloured cravat. Not a wrinkle or scuff mars his clothes, no matter the hour. In place of jewellery, he wears only a gold-plated pocket watch, suspended from a chain that vanishes into his waistcoat—an heirloom, perhaps, always consulted, never flaunted.

Wallace typically carries a ledger which he uses to track tasks, from the precise hour the east windows were last polished to the moment the vineyard’s row 12A was pruned. But Wallace himself needs little prompting. He has memorized every hallway creak, every tendril of ivy that creeps too far, every shift in the grapevine canopy before harvest.

He manages the troupe of golems that attend to the estate, redirecting them when they need diverted to other tasks.  Given the clockwork routine of the golems, Wallace often finds himself with little to do aside from serve tea and attend to the needs of his mistress.

### Edward Grimley

Edward Grimley is the sort of man carved by wind and work—stout, broad-shouldered, and built like a weatherworn stone wall. Standing just under six feet, his frame is square and solid, with a weight that suggests strength earned from decades of lifting sacks of soil and hauling unruly vines into submission. His gait has a measured heaviness to it, more deliberate than stiff, as though he were more comfortable moving through fields than parlours.

His skin is deeply tanned and freckled, marked by sun, wind, and the occasional errant thorn. A wide nose sits above a perpetual frown line, and his brow—low and thick—gives his gray eyes a slightly shadowed, watchful intensity. The eyes themselves are pale and clear, sharp despite his age, with a habit of squinting at people as though reading the soil beneath their boots.

Most defining are his mutton chops—dense, silvered masses of facial hair that sweep down his cheeks in defiance of time and trend. His jaw is often dusted with garden soil, despite his best efforts, and he smells faintly of crushed rosemary and loam. His hair, what’s left of it, is kept short on top and combed back, thick and iron-coloured, more salt than pepper now.

Grimley wears tough, weathered canvas trousers tucked into scuffed leather boots, and a work shirt that’s seen every season twice over. Over it he dons a dark green utility vest crisscrossed with tool loops, bits of cord, and smudges of chalky enchantment powder. A broad-brimmed felt hat sits askew when he’s not using it, and a small satchel hangs at his side, clinking faintly with pruning charms and vine-binders.

Edward manages the golems in the garden, and chases off any children who attempt to sneak into the estate.  You would think that with the golems, he would have very little to do, but this is not the case.  Golems are good at repetitive tasks, but managing a garden and a vineyard is more of an art - so he often gives them gentle commands to change their routine.
