# Description

The Bramblewood schoolhouse sits at the edge of the green, its weathered stone walls and moss-softened roof a quiet fixture of the village for generations. Built over seventy years ago from local timber and fieldstone, the structure is plain and practical—just one room, with a hearth at the back and a crooked bell that clatters out the start of lessons when the wind’s not too strong.

Only a handful of children attend these days. In a farming village like Bramblewood, many families see more use in sturdy boots and steady hands than ink and parchment. Still, the schoolhouse opens most mornings, rain or shine, and those who come learn their numbers, their letters, and enough geography to know where the river meets the sea.

The desks are mismatched, some carved with initials long grown over, and the books are few—passed down, patched, and pencilled in. Chalk dust coats the windowsills, and the teacher keeps a kettle warm on the hearth when the frost sets in.

It’s not a place of grand learning, nor does it try to be. But for those who sit at its desks, the schoolhouse is where curiosity first takes root—between the clatter of firewood and the scratching of quills.

# Notable Characters

### Elsbeth Havra

Elsbeth Havra was born in a riverside hamlet two valleys east of Bramblewood, the eldest of four daughters. Her father was a cobbler with poor eyesight, and from a young age, Elsbeth took on the role of reading letters and balancing ledgers for him. It was there she discovered her love of learning—letters, numbers, and the quiet logic of ink and paper.

She attended a modest town school in Eldmere for several years, supported by a distant uncle who believed in “books over brawn.” When the funding dried up, she returned home and took up tutoring for merchant families, eventually earning enough to travel a bit—never far, but enough to see different ways of teaching and different types of children.

When the previous Bramblewood schoolteacher retired—some say abruptly, after a particularly chaotic spring—Elsbeth answered the call. She arrived with one trunk, a small kettle, and more chalk than the village had ever owned at once. Since then, she has quietly kept the schoolhouse running: fire lit, ink dried, and slates wiped clean.

She lives in a narrow cottage behind the [[Locations/Bramblewood/Locations/The Church of Chauntea\|The Church of Chauntea]], grows leeks and onions in her garden, and walks to the school with a satchel of papers and a firm, sensible stride.
