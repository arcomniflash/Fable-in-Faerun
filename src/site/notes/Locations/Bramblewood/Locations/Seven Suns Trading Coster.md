# Description

The Seven Suns Trading Coster is perhaps one of the largest buildings in Bramblewood.  It is a three story building made of aging timber and carved stone with mismatched red tiles.  The red and yellow banners for the Seven Suns Trading Consortium hang from flagpoles protruding from the upper floors.  The Coster serves as a kind of combination trading post and general store, and it is where the post for the village is generally received as well.  Merchants come once or twice a week to sell of their wares and keep the village provided with whatever it cannot grow, smith or weave for itself.  Although these good are primarily of the mundane variety, one or two magical items sneak in on occasion - though they are usually extremely expensive.

Seven Suns itself is a large trading consortium based in Athkatla - it has trading posts built in towns and villages throughout the region.  This means that as far as control over individual trading posts goes, the consortium is spread somewhat thin.  As such it generally leaves the management of these trading posts to enterprising locals, allowing them to use the name of the Consortium as free advertising in exchange for access to a wider range of stock.

# Notable Characters

### Lazzo Driftwhistle

An enterprising old gnome who runs the Seven Suns Trading Coster, white haired and bespectacled, the squat figure of Lazzo is never seen without his long pipe.   He tends to wear expensive looking clothing to try and emphasise his position in the village and the importance of his role.  This rather smug manner means that not exactly well liked in the village, and he tends to relax in his raised chair behind the counter of the store while a small group of assistants get on with the real work.  Lazzo is a fat old gnome, and is rather shrewd, always trying to get the best deal out of any exchange whether it takes the form of dialogue or bartering.  He hasn't heard from his immediate superiors in the Seven Suns in quite a long time and is currently enjoying the freedom that brings, though he does know well enough not to jack up the prices to an extent that would get him tossed out of the village.

### Lazzo's Assistants

Lazzo is assisted by three people, two men and one woman, all humans.  They are all relatively young, and tend to perform a great many of the menial tasks around the Coster while Lazzo himself minds the shop and does not much else.  The two men are Darnith and his brother Davick, two youths whose family insisted that getting into the mercantile business was more profitable than farming.   They hope that they will be able to learn from Lazzo and eventually go their own way as traders - according to Lazzo, this day looks to be a long way off.  The girl is Winny, who is a cheerful, chipper girl in her late teens.  She is usually tasked with either taking inventory or minding the storefront when Lazzo himself cannot be bothered doing so.
