# Description

A church dedicated to Chauntea, the Goddess of nature, farming and the harvest.  Chauntea's symbol is the rose, and there are roses all over this building - in the garden and cemetery outside, in the reliefs carved into the stonework, and embroidered in the drapery within.  The church has a steeple form which a silver bell rings when the faithful are to be called to morning communion, and large stained glass windows depict images of the Goddess herself.  The building is surrounded by a low stone wall, fitted together long again when the village was first founded.  

The interior of the church speaks of a union of people and nature, and the cycle of taking from the land and giving back to it.  There are no true pews, simply rows of small chairs for people to sit in while they listen to the words of the local cleric.  Images of crops, wheat, barley and fruit line the walls, and plants are woven through the architecture.  A green carpet leads up to the main pulpit from when the Priestess of Chauntea speaks.

# Notable Characters

### Mother Talantha

The priestess of Chauntea who serves at the small church in Bramblewood carries the serene warmth of the harvest in both her bearing and appearance. Mother Talantha, as the villagers call her, is a woman in her early fifties, with a round, sun-kissed face and gentle lines that crease deeper when she smiles—which is often. Her skin is bronzed by decades spent in the garden and field, and her eyes are the rich green of summer barley, flecked with gold near the pupils.

Her hair is a warm chestnut streaked with straw-coloured grey, worn in a thick braid down her back, sometimes entwined with sprigs of dried lavender or corn husk ribbons on holy days. Strong from a life of labour and nurture, her hands are calloused but kind, always smelling faintly of rosemary, oil, and loam.

She wears a simple but lovingly maintained habit in shades of russet and wheat, the traditional hues of Chauntea’s clergy. Her robes are loose-fitting and made of sturdy homespun linen, dyed with natural pigments. A soft shawl of undyed wool rests across her shoulders, fastened with a wooden brooch carved in the shape of a blooming sheaf of grain. Around her waist, a belt of braided cord holds a waterskin, pruning shears, and a small leather-bound book of prayers and planting charts.

Most striking is the holy symbol of Chauntea she wears around her neck: a sun-disk carved from golden applewood, etched with tiny runes of blessing. On feast days, she adorns her robe with seasonal offerings—woven wheat garlands, apple blossoms, or wreaths of barley—and she often walks barefoot in the church garden as a sign of reverence for the earth.

She moves with the easy grace of one at peace with her duties—part gardener, part healer, and part guardian of Bramblewood’s quiet faith.
