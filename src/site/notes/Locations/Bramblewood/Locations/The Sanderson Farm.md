# Description

Just south of the village, where the land begins to rise into gentle, sunlit hills, sits the Sanderson farm—a patchwork of golden cornfields and open pasture bordered by low stone walls and wind-worn wooden fences. The farmhouse itself is a wide, two-story structure with whitewashed walls, red shutters, and a generous porch that creaks contentedly in the evening breeze. A copper weather vane shaped like a rooster spins slowly atop the barn roof.

The fields around the farm are planted thick with corn, rustling in waves during the summer and turning to dry whispers by autumn. Crows wheel overhead, and scarecrows—each with their own odd charm—keep watch like sleepy sentinels. To the east, sheep graze along the slope, their soft bleats drifting across the yard. A smaller herd of cows—mostly dun or brindled—moves slowly through the lower pasture, placid and trusted.

Old Abner Sanderson runs the farm with his two sons, Elric and Tomlin, while his wife, Marga, tends to the garden and the smokehouse behind the barn. The family is known for their practical kindness, hearty breakfasts, and a certain stubborn pride when it comes to doing things the old way.

Children from the village sometimes help with chores in exchange for sweet corn or sheep’s milk cheese, and there’s talk that the Sandersons once hosted a harvest dance in the big barn before anyone can properly remember when. There's always work to be done, but there's a rhythm to the place—weathered, steady, and full of life.

# Notable Characters

### Abner Sanderson

Abner was born just outside Bramblewood and has never lived anywhere else. He grew up on the same land he now runs, learning to mend fences, shear sheep, and plant corn from his father and uncles. Nothing dramatic ever pulled him away—he simply kept doing what needed doing.

He married Marga when they were both young, mostly because it made sense at the time, and together they raised two sons, who now handle most of the heavy work. Over the years, Abner added a few cows, learned how to fix just about anything with spare twine and an old nail, and found he had a good eye for when weather was turning.

These days, he still rises with the sun, checks the pasture fences, and mutters about the price of salt and the state of the well. He’s not retired—he wouldn’t know what to do with himself if he were—but he’s perfectly content letting the boys take the lead while he keeps an eye on things.

He is a man with years of steady routine under his belt, a soft spot for sheepdogs, and an uncanny ability to predict the first frost within a day or two.

### Marga Sanderson

Marga grew up just a few miles outside Bramblewood and always figured she’d marry into a farm—though she was hoping for one with fewer thistles. She met her husband at a midsummer gathering, said he looked stubborn enough to last, and was proven right. Since then, she’s kept the Sanderson farm running.

She’s no village herbalist or hedge-witch—though she knows which flowers help with burns and which teas ease a cough. Mostly, Marga does what needs doing: churning butter, salting meat, keeping the garden in shape, and making sure her boys wash behind their ears. She’s the one who minds the smokehouse, checks the root cellar, and fixes the bread oven when the stones shift from frost.

She doesn’t have patience for nonsense but has plenty for sourdough. She keeps a detailed ledger of supplies, scolds the hens like wayward cousins, and brews a thistle tonic strong enough to knock the wind back into a grown man. When she has time—which isn’t often—she knits with leftover wool scraps by the hearth, but even then she keeps one ear turned toward the barn.

She may not be the loudest voice on the farm, but if something breaks, wanders off, or falls apart, she’ll be the first to notice—and the last to complain.

### Elric Sanderson

Elric’s been part of the farm for as long as he’s been able to walk without falling into a trough. He’s the older of the two Sanderson boys, and though he sometimes acts like he’d rather be anywhere else, he’s never actually left Bramblewood for more than a market day. He’s quick on his feet, good with animals, and known to grumble about chores while doing them faster than most.

He’s got a restless streak—a habit of looking out across the fields like he’s waiting for something more—but he knows the land, and he’s good at what he does. Sheep listen to him, cows nudge him for extra feed, and even the barn cat tolerates his presence. He’s decent with tools, better with stories, and has a knack for getting the last word in when no one asked for it.

Elric handles a lot of the outdoor work now: moving the flock, checking fence lines, helping with the corn harvest when it’s time. He’s strong, but more lean than broad, with hands that show calluses and bandages in equal measure. He wears his father’s old work cloak when it’s cold, even though it’s a bit too big, and he’s always got twine or a pocketknife on him, just in case.

He may talk big about leaving one day—joining a caravan or guarding the northern roads—but so far, he’s always been there at sunrise, boots muddy, sleeves rolled, ready to get on with it.

### Tomlin Sanderson

Tomlin is the younger Sanderson son, quieter than his brother and steadier by far. Where Elric talks and grumbles, Tomlin simply listens—and then gets the job done without complaint. He has the kind of presence that doesn’t draw attention, but things seem to go smoother when he’s around.

He’s built stockier than his brother, with broad shoulders and thick forearms from hauling feed and wrestling with stubborn sheep. His brown hair is always a bit tousled, and he tends to forget about smudges of dirt on his cheek or a straw sticking out of his collar. His clothes are plain—woolen tunic and trousers, usually a faded green or soft gray—and always patched in the knees. He doesn’t care about looking tidy, just comfortable enough to move and warm enough to stay out in the wind.

Tomlin spends most of his time with the animals. He’s especially good with the sheep—he knows their habits, their calls, and when one’s about to fall ill before anyone else notices. He doesn’t say much, but when he does speak, it’s thoughtful and to the point. Some say he’s got his mother’s sense and his father’s calm, wrapped in a softer shell.

While Elric might be dreaming of roads beyond Bramblewood, Tomlin seems perfectly content where he is. The fields suit him, the animals trust him, and he’s never far from the rhythm of the land.

There is, perhaps, one thing that flusters Tomlin more than a lambing gone sideways—and that’s Marra, the girls who works at the [[Locations/Bramblewood/Locations/Bakery\|Bakery]]. She’s the type who whistles while she works, always quick with a clever remark when she drops off a bread for the farm, and never seems to mind the mud on Tomlin’s boots.

### Bran

very good farm needs a set of sharp eyes and a quicker tail—and the Sandersons have Bran, a black-and-white sheepdog with a streak of grey across one ear and more sense than half the village put together. He was born in the spring storms nearly a decade ago, the runt of the litter, but proved himself sharper and swifter than anyone expected.

Bran knows every inch of the pasture, every sheep by scent, and most of Elric’s shortcuts before Elric thinks of them. He responds to whistles, clicks, and the subtle twitch of Tomlin’s hand, and when a ewe strays too far, he’s already halfway there before anyone can shout. He sleeps by the door, shares scraps with Marga, and growls only at crows and the alderman’s goat.

Abner claims he’s the smartest creature on the farm—though Marga would argue the smokehouse cat holds that title after five winters of evading chores.
