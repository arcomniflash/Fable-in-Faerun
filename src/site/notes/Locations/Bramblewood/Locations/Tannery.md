# Description

The tannery and leatherworking shop in Bramblewood is a long, low-slung structure tucked near the streambank, where fresh water aids both the cleaning and curing of hides. Its walls are a mix of aged timber and wattle, daubed in places to keep the draft out, and its southern side is shaded by a lean-to where drying racks and scraped hides hang from thick wooden poles. The scent is strong—sharp with lye and smoke—but not unpleasant to those used to it, especially with the constant breeze off the stream.

The building houses two main sections: a darker, cooler rear room where soaking vats and stretching frames are kept, and a front-facing workshop, open to the daylight, where the finer craft happens. Here, leather is stitched, dyed, embossed, and shaped into goods both practical and decorative: satchels, bridles, belts, gloves, and the occasional commission for tooled armour.

A low stone wall wraps part of the yard, where scraps are piled, and a few dogs linger, lazing in the sun. Locals pass by with a knowing nod or a short whistle—this is the place that’s kept boots dry and saddles sound for two generations.

# Notable Characters

### Rheya Tarn

Rheya Tarn grew up a stone’s throw from the tannery that would one day bear her name. Her parents worked hides, mended tack, and stitched saddles for generations of Bramblewood folk—and though they never called themselves craftsmen, their goods outlasted most of the beasts they were made for. Rheya learned the trade young: how to scrape a hide clean by lantern light, how to spot a weak stitch by the way it tugged.

After a few youthful years chasing markets in distant towns, Rheya returned to Bramblewood in her thirties, carrying new tools, a few debts, and a sharper sense of her worth. She took over the family shop, streamlining the tanning process and branching into finer goods—satchels, journals, and custom-fit armour pieces. Under her hand, the humble workshop became a cornerstone of the village’s craft community, supplying leather to the smiths, cordwainers, and even the hunters from the wooded reaches.

Now in her early forties, Rheya runs the tannery with firm hands and bark-tanned pride. She handles most of the curing and shaping work herself, while mentoring her apprentice, Tib Renn, through the subtler arts of embossing and finishing. She’s known for no-nonsense advice, dependable gear, and the occasional glimmer of mischief, especially if there’s plum brandy involved.

### Tib Renn

Tib Renn grew up in the quieter corners of Bramblewood, the kind of boy more likely to be found sketching patterns in the dirt with a stick than climbing trees or chasing dogs. The son of a woodcutter and a weaver, he was expected to take up one of those trades—but leather captured his attention the first time he saw a traveling merchant’s saddle tooled with gold-threaded designs.

He started shadowing Rheya Tarn in his mid-teens, offering to sweep the floors and carry scraps just to be near the tools. She didn’t take him seriously until she caught him tracing patterns into scrap hide by lantern light—his lines clumsy, but his focus unwavering. Impressed by his persistence and eye for detail, she took him on formally a year later.

Now around nineteen, Tib is Rheya’s only apprentice, responsible for everything from hide scraping to stitching pouches—but his true passion is _embossing and decorative work_. He experiments constantly, carving runes, leaves, and strange sigils into offcuts, even as he mutters about being stuck tanning hides when he could be crafting “actual pieces of art.”

While he plays at being disgruntled, his commitment to the craft is genuine, and Rheya’s grudging praise means more to him than he lets on. Locals sometimes tease that he’s “too clever for his boots,” but most of them carry something he’s worked on—even if they don’t know it.

### Bristle

ristle isn’t much for pedigrees or ceremony—just an old shaggy mutt with mismatched ears and a tail that curls like a question mark when he’s curious, which is often. No one in Bramblewood quite remembers where he came from. One day he wasn’t there; the next he was dozing on a warm hide outside the tannery like he’d always belonged.

Rheya Tarn tried to chase him off at first—work and wet leather don’t mix well with muddy paws and a nose for trouble. But Bristle had a knack for knowing where not to step, and a loyal streak that ran deeper than his scruffy coat. Eventually, she gave up and carved him a spot near the drying racks, shaded and dry.

Now well into his grey-whiskered years, Bristle is the tannery’s unofficial guardian and greeter. He follows Rheya from the shop to the river and back again, always staying just far enough out of the way—but close enough to grumble if she forgets to share her lunch. He keeps Tib company when the apprentice grits through hidework alone and will bark once—just once—if someone unfamiliar walks too close to a finished order.

Children feed him scraps. Elders call him “Old Boots.” And if you ask Rheya, she’ll swear she never meant to keep a dog… but Bristle decided otherwise.
